# Module 1 – Getting Started with Java
## Practical Exercises (Banking Context)

This module introduces Java basics through simple banking-related scenarios.  
The goal is to understand variables, operators, and Strings by modeling real-life banking operations.

## Exercise 1 – Using Variables and Assignment Operators

### Context
You are developing a simple banking system.  
A customer has a bank account with an initial balance.  
The bank needs to update the account balance when deposits and withdrawals occur.

### Requirements
- Declare an integer variable to represent the account balance.
- Initialize the balance with an initial value.
- Display the initial balance.
- Add a deposit amount to the balance using a compound assignment operator.
- Display the updated balance after the deposit.
- Subtract a withdrawal amount from the balance using a compound assignment operator.
- Display the final balance after the withdrawal.

## Exercise 2 – Currency Conversion Using Arithmetic Operators

### Context
A customer travels abroad and needs to convert money from one currency to another.  
The banking system must handle currency conversion, spending, and reconversion.

### Requirements
- Declare a variable representing an amount in USD.
- Declare a variable representing the exchange rate from USD to EUR.
- Display the initial amount in USD.
- Convert the amount from USD to EUR using a multiplication operator.
- Display the converted amount in EUR.
- Deduct an expense in EUR from the converted amount.
- Display the remaining balance in EUR.
- Convert the remaining amount back to USD using a division operator.
- Display the final amount in USD.

## Exercise 3 – Working with Customer Information Using Strings

### Context
In a banking system, Strings are used to store and manipulate customer information such as names, account references, and messages.

### Requirements
Using a String variable representing a customer name:
- Display the length of the String.
- Display the character at a specific position in the String.
- Extract and display a portion of the String.
- Compare the customer name with another String and display the result.
- Convert the String to uppercase and display it.
- Convert the String to lowercase and display it.
- Check whether the String contains a specific sequence of characters and display the result.
- Replace specific characters in the String and display the updated value.

## Notes
- All exercises must be implemented in Java.
- Each exercise should be written in a separate class.
- The focus is on understanding Java basics, not on building a complete banking system.
- Code clarity and correct use of variables and operators are essential.
