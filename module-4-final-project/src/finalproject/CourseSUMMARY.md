### Summary
This text recaps the key lessons from Course 1 of a Java programming journey. It starts with Module 1, introducing software development basics like roles, responsibilities, SDLC, variables, data types, operators, and strings (e.g., manipulating text like names or sentences). Module 2 covers control flow with if/else statements and loops (for and while) for decision-making and repetition, such as age-based ticket pricing. Module 3 dives into OOP concepts: classes/methods as blueprints/behaviors, inheritance, polymorphism for flexibility, encapsulation for data protection, and abstraction to hide complexity. The course ends with a final project—a Java zoo management system—to integrate all skills, emphasizing problem-solving, practice, and growth beyond just coding.

### Key Takeaways
- **Software Development Essentials**: It's about problem-solving, creativity, and SDLC—not just code.
- **Java Basics (Module 1)**: Master variables, data types, operators, and strings for data handling and text manipulation.
- **Control Flow (Module 2)**: Use if/else for decisions and loops for automation.
- **OOP Principles (Module 3)**: Classes/methods build objects; inheritance/polymorphism add reusability; encapsulation/abstraction ensure organization and simplicity.
- **Apply & Grow**: Build the digital banking project to demonstrate skills; keep practicing and experimenting to evolve as a developer.
